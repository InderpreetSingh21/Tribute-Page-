        <h2>Here's a timeline of Guru Nanak Dev Ji's life:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1469: Guru Nanak was born into a Hindu family in the village of Talwandi, in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent. During this time, there were conflicts between various religions and people were fighting amongst each other.</li>
            <li>1487: Guru Nanak is bathing in a river when he goes missing for three days. Upon his return, he explains that he heard a call to dedicate himself to humanity, proclaiming, “There is no Hindu, no Muslim,” in a declaration that “there is one God and one human race.”</li>
            <li>1499: Guru Nanak begins teaching about women’s equality, emphasizing that discrimination against women is a denial of the oneness of all beings.</li>
            <li>1500-1506: The First Udasi of Guru Nanak. He traveled across modern Pakistan to spread his teachings of compassion, equality, and kindness.</li>
            <li>1506-1513: The Second Udasi of Guru Nanak; he travelled to Sri Lanka, accompanied by a Muslim companion, Bhai Mardana, in an expression of religious tolerance.</li>
            <li>1514-1518: The Third Udasi of Guru Nanak, during which he traveled to Nepal and Tibet, spreading his message of truth, love, and oneness.</li>
            <li>1519-1521: The Fourth Udasi of Guru Nanak, reaching as far as the Arab countries and visiting Mecca. His followers began to call him “guru,” meaning teacher.</li>
            <li>1523-1524: The Fifth and Final Udasi of Guru Nanak, during which he traveled around Punjab, having spent over two decades traveling on foot.</li>
            <li>1524: Guru Nanak settles in Kartarpur for his remaining years, serving as a living example of the teachings he preached.</li>
            <li>1539: Guru Nanak passes away. Upon his death, there was debate over whether he would be cremated in the Hindu tradition or buried according to Muslim tradition. He resolved the argument by instructing that Hindus should leave flowers on his right side, and Muslims on his left, determining the ritual based on which flowers were fresh the next day.</li>
        </ul>
